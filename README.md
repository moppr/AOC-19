# My Attempt on Advent of Code 2019
https://adventofcode.com/

I discovered this challenge via my friends in my university's ACM chapter, and while I started off by just throwing myself out there and seeing if I was able to handle it, I quickly realized that this was a pretty good opportunity to teach myself some new techniques and better coding practices than I would normally encounter just doing coursework.

All solutions are being done first in Python. I am opting not to focus 100% on readability/maintainability so I can try and play around with Python and learn more about what tools I have at my disposal. They are still important and are in constant consideration, though.

I'll also be attempting a port to other languages such as Java later on to shake off some of the dust.
